## Structure

- The directory `./Drivers` and `./Middlewares` contains the HAL drivers generated by CubeMX, you may ignore them.
- The directory `./RM2025-Internal-Core` contains the drivers. You may ignore the FreeRTOS and diagnostic directories as we have already set them up for you.
- You have to implement your own drivers, such as rc or motors driver in `./RM2025-Internal-Core\Drivers`
- You may use the drivers in the Core directory developed by you and implement applications of the tasks in `./Core\Src` and `./Core\Inc`
- Within `./Core/Inc/AppConfig.h`, you could enable/disable certain drivers and configure them. Port configurations had been configured according to the Internal board design.
- Tasks are created in `./Core/Src/UserTask.cpp`. You may set initializing code here
- Most of your code may happen in `./RM2025-Internal-Core/Drivers` and `./Core/Src`.

Wish good luck.
